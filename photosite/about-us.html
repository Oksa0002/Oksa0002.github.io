                Photographs are the universal language of our era. Everyone has hundreds,
                maybe thousands in their pocket. Weightless, they turn the scale when the
                argument is: What happened here? Images don’t age or warp. A great
                photographer’s strings never go out of tune.
            </p>

                It is for this reason that we need photographers. They are the ones who sort
                all the chaos of the world into images that bring clarity to the free-for-all
                of life. They are the witnesses and artists who can distill the mayhem and
                beauty that surrounds us. They call our attention to the things we miss in
                our everyday lives and they call our attention to events and people at a great
                distance from our own patch of the universe. When they direct our eyes and
                hearts with precision and honesty, we know what we know differently and better.
                Photographers teach us to look again, look harder. Look through their eyes.
