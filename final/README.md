While I was working on creating my Web Portfolio, I had struggled with a few challenges. It took some time to position text on the images, as I have quite a few. I was using “position” and “transform” properties to make text over the image, as it was on my original mock-up. Also, I had some issues with my photo on the ‘About Page’. When I used the “float” to give a right position for my image, there was a problem with the alignment. To fix this problem, I decided to use “clearfix” hack and it helped to align the image properly. Facing this issue helped me teach myself how to align my images accurately and position text on top of any images I need.
To create my portfolio I was using Unsplash Free Images and Google Fonts.
